// Storage management for bignums is sort of delicate because at the
// start of an operation one normally has just an upper bound on how much
// space will be needed - the exact number of words to be used only emerges
// at the end. So the protocol I support is based on the calls:
//   uint64_t *preallocate(size_t n)
//      This returns a pointer to n 64-bit words (and it may have allocated
//      a space for a header in front of that).
//   number_representation_t confirm_size(uint64_t *p, size_t n, size_t final_n)
//      The pointer p was as returned by preallocate, but it is now known
//      that just final_n words will be needed (this must be no larger than
//      the number originally given. The effect can be somewhat as if a call
//      to realloc was given. Very often this will also write the final_n
//      into a header tha preceeds the stored digits of the number. It would
//      be able to detect (eg) a special case of small numbers are return
//      them in a different way, and add any other tag or marker bits that
//      are required. When confirm_size() is called the system can be
//      confident that no other calls to preallocate() have been made - this
//      can help because it then "knows" that the memory involved is right
//      at the fringe of active memory.
//   number_representation_t confirm_size_x(uint64_t *p, size_t n, size_t final_n)
//      This behave just like confirm_size apart from the fact that it is to
//      used in a context where two (or more) regions of memory have been
//      preallocated. This must be used on all but the last allocated one
//      when their length is confirmed. The thought behind this is that
//      when a block shrinks or is discarded and it is not the most recent one
//      allocated it may be necessary to put some padding material in the
//      gap that is left, or it may be possible to place that released
//      space on a free-chain for future re-use.
//      As a special case if two blocks are preallocated and the second
//      has its size confirmed as zero then the first one may use
//      confirm_size rather than needing confirm_size_x.
//   void free_bignum(number_representation p)
//      Release memory. In a Lisp system this will be a no-op because garbage
//      collection will do the job. In a freestanding application this

//
// For strings (as returned when I want to prepare a bignum for printing)
// I will use preallocate as before and an effect is that the string will
// be built up within a block of memory that is a multiple of 8 bytes long.
// Again there MAY be space left for a header. When I know exactly how many
// characters are present I will confirm the exact size required:
//
//   string_representation confirm_size_string(uint64_t *p, size_t n, size_t final_n)
//       In this call n is the original size as used with preallocate, so it
//       measures in units of sizeof(uint64_t), while final_size is measured
//       in bytes and is the number of characters present. For native style
//       strings this will add a '\0' as a terminator and use realloc to
//       trim the size down to include just that.
