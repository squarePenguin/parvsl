A lisp implementation with multi-threading support. To be used
in REDUCE to implement parallel numerical algorithms.

Looks like I am going to use VSL, the lightweight implementation.
It is lighter(4k lines of code) and interpreted, but also slower.
Still it allows benchmarks etc. 

It already provides a conservative GC. I will augment that to support
multiple-threads, using a stop-the-world approach.
