//     levels). Specifically there will not be a fixed heap size implicit
//     in an image file, and word-length, byte order and machine architecture
//     should be allowed for.
// (2) Compiled code should be preserved within a heap image, but if the
//     image is reloaded on a machine with a different architecture then
//     a form of just-in-time compilation will be activated to create
//     code for the new machine from a compact bytecode representation
//     stored in the image. If the architecture has not been provided with
//     a native JIT compiler then the bytecodes will be interpreted
//     directly.
// (3) Image files will be compressed (using zlib) and so will tend to be
//     compact.
