* Introduction

The motivation of this project is to explore the implementation of multi-threading
capabilities within a working compiler and assess the benefits and tradeoffs it brings
to an established, real-world application with a large, actively-developed body of code. 

** REDUCE

[[https://reduce-algebra.sourceforge.io/][REDUCE]] is a portable general-purpose algebra system (CAS). It enables symbolic
manipulation of mathematical expressions and provides a wide range of algorithms
to solve problems spanning many fields, with arbitrary precision numerical approximation. 
It has a friendly user interface and can display maths and generate graphics.

REDUCE is one of a few open-source general-purpose CAS programs, alongside Maxima and Axiom.
The three projects are all built on top of different Lisp kernels. At the time of this writing,
none of these projects have any multi-threaded capabilities. My aim is to remove this limitation
for REDUCE. The project is using its own Lisp dialect which is similar to Common Lisp, but has its
own design and set of capabilities.

** VSL

Over the years, there have been multiple implementations of the Lisp compiler REDUCE is using, with
different goals: PSL, CSL and VSL. VSL is an interpreted language written in the programming
language C. It is fully capable of building the entirety of REDUCE, supports all the major 
platforms and architectures, and is well optimised for speed, minimising the performance tradeoff
of being interpreted.

** TODO Argue for the benefits of multithreading

The idea of using parallel computing to speed up computer algebra computing has come
up in research papers for many years ~TODO reference it~, but much of the activity now
predates the now ubiquitous multi-core CPUs used in modern computers and the amount of memory
they now provide. Moreover, advancements in single-core CPU performance has slowed down
significantly, as clock speeds have stagnated and even gone down in recent years. The biggest
area of imrpovement in these new CPUs is their core count and number of hardware threads.
Binding the performance of Reduce to single-threaded performance is likely to lead to
a limitation in speed gains from new hardware.


* TODO Preparation

** From C to C++

The VSL language was written in the programming language C. C is a language with no standardised
multi-threaded model and no native support for multi-core programming. Furthermore, it has no well-defined
memory model, and no ordering of memory accesses. Multi-threaded programming
is only possible in C through a third-party library, such as ~Windows threads~ or the 
the ~POSIX threads~ library on UNIX systems. Support further has to be guaranteed by individual compilers
and operating systems and can break between versions.

C++ is a superset of C and can compile existing, standard C code easily. The C++11 standard addresses the
above omissions, making C++ a multi-threaded language. While in some cases the implementation uses the same
libraries as the C equivalend (e.g POSIX), we do not have to think about these details and the code
we write is fully portable. The only requirement is that a C++11 compliant compiler is used to compile the
code and then which platforms these compilers can target.

The first change I have made to the implementation is to clear it of any incompatible code and compile it
with a C++ compiler. This was a trivial task and mostly involved adding a few more explicit casts.
However, I have been slowly transitioning the code from idiomatic C++ as I analysed more parts of it
and became confident those changes wouldn't affect the semantics.

** TODO ParVSL

I have forked the the original VSL project into a new language which I call for simplicity Parallel VSL, or ParVSL.


** TODO Throughput vs latency
** TODO Memory allocation
Memory allocation is made in large continuous blocks. Global heap pointer
variables manage these blocks and generally handle Lisp allocations
by designating enough space within these blocks and incrementing the
heap pointer.
** TODO Garbage collector
*** TODO Conservative GC
*** TODO Cheaney's algorithm

** TODO Saving state to disk

* TODO Implementation

** TODO Memory allocation


All the memory is global and shared, and multiple-threads will often try
to allocate concurently, causing contention. A naive solution to this problem
would have been to use a mutex lock on allocations. While this approach would
have been the simplest to implement it would also significantly slow down the language.
Allocations are on the critical path of the runtime, and they are needed constantly.
Serialising allocations is guaranteed to slow down the language enough to cancel 
any advantage multi-threading brings to the language.

Instead, the approach was to further split the memory into isolated regions.
The term /segment/ will be used throughout to talk about a thread_local block 
within memory. Just like before, memory is allocated to the segments in the continuous 
fashion. A pointer indicates the start of the non-allocated part of the segment(the /fringe/.), 
while another tells us the end of the segment. Now, contention is reduced to getting a new
segment. Each thread only allocates within its own segment, so allocations do not require
any synchronisation, and they still only require incrementing one variable in most
cases.

The code was modified so that checks and operations on the global block "fringe"
affect the thread-local segment fringe. The block fringe is only modified under a lock
when a thread asks for a new segment. Segment sizes can be decided dinamically,
but will generally be a minimum fixed size which has to be tuned for performance.
The tradeoff here is performance vs memory. If the segments are too small then there
will be contention as threads request new segments too often. When segments are larger than 
needed, they hold chunks of memory from being used by other threads and can lead 
to more garbage collection cycles. 

** TODO Shared memory and global variables

VSL has dynamic scoping and exhibits shallow binding. This means there is a global
storage mapping each symbol to exactly one value. A variable is defined as long 
as the symbol is assigned a value. The user can explicitly mark a symbol as global
or fluid. A global symbol only has a global value and cannot be locally bound.
A fluid symbol can have both a global value and a locally bound value. The way this
is accomplished is by saving the global value on every binding and then restoring it
as soon as the binding is over. 

This shallow binding approach is incompatible with a multi-threaded program: a symbol
could be locally bound to different values on different threads. One approach to solving the
issue is to use a deep-binding approach: passing around an associative list mapping the symbols
to values. The approach would add a penalty to performance, however it should be investigated
how significant the trade-off is. Instead, I have modified the code to try to keep the
shallow-binding. Global values work just as before and no modification is needed. For local and
fluids however, I added a thread-local storage array. The global storage now only
holds a pointer to the array location where the actual value is stored. This way, each thread can
hold its own version of the symbol and modify it safely. For fluids, there will still be a global
shared value. Since I already used the global storage for the pointer, I added one more global
array, where the pointer indicates the global value.

** TODO Thread data and garbage collection

The garbage collector is stop-the-world and work by tracing reachable memory locations
starting from a root set. There are two types of roots: ambiguous and unambigous. Unambiguous
roots are the ones explicitly managed by the compiler, e.g the symbol table of variables.
Since the compiler is written in C and memory is not tagged, we can also get ambigous pointer:
values on the C stack which might be just values but could also be pointers to program storage.

The handling of both of these root sets has to account for multiple running threads. All the new
thread-local storage was added to the unambiguous root set. Additionally, each thread is running its
own stack so all the stacks has to be accounted for as the ambiguous root set. The latter is more complicated.
All threads have to be paused before garbage collection can begin so that they do not interfere
with memory. A simple way to do this is to enable a global flag which all threads check on a regular basis.
However, if we are not careful, this can easily cause a deadlock (e.g: thread A waits for a signal from
thread B, but thread B is waiting for garbage collection). To solve such issues, I need to make two
changes. First, I must modify the functions in the interpreter to poll the global flag. Then I have
to make all waiting calls put a thread into a /safe/ state before sleeping, so that the garbage collector
can proceed with the thread. This is still a work in progress.

** TODO Saving state to disk and reloading

One important feature of the language is the ability to preserve the state of the world at any
time and save to disk. It is difficult to keep the same guarantees when multiple threads are running:
preserving when some of the threads are running a computation is tricky to define properly. To simplify
matter, I have decided that all threads have to be joined before preserving. This way, the state of
the world is consistent and relatively easy to restore. I have modified parts of the code to write
all the thread-local data back into global storage and then restore it when reloading. This way the same
file format is preserved, and I have not broken compatibility between single and multi-threaded images. 

** TODO Implementing threads

Once all the modifications above were made, implementing the actual multi-threading mechanism was an easy
task. I used the standard library to start and join threads and created a thread table so that data about
all threads can be accessed globally. WHen a  new thread is created, it registers a pointer to its thread-local
data in the table. Using this, I added code to the garbage collector to handle all existing threads and
extract the roots, but also to manage their allocation segments, which have to be reset after collection.
Finally, primitive functions for threading were added to the language. They simply mirror their C++ counterparts.
