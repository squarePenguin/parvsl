// If you decorate some data defintions as "thread_local" on Linux or
// OSX you can use then from threaded code and each thread will see its own
// version of the data. The time overhead is rather modest. If you do the
// same on Windows (at least in Q1 2019, using either cygwin or mingw32)
// each function that will access thread_local data does a system call to
// find where its thread-specific data is. If the function then does a large
// amount of work (perhaps using the thread_local values) this is not too
// bad, but a small function can have a really severe overhead. A case close
// to worst would be
//      thread_local int val;
//      void my_function() { val++; }
// in circumstances where my_function() can not be inlined and so the
// identity of the thread_local variable had to be established on every call.
// The cost overheads are large enough that they can hurt overall performance
// at a whole-program level.
// The code here is intended to circumvent this. It does so at the cost of
// restricting stack-size under Windows to some fixed amount (by default
// one megabtye), by reducing protection against stack overflow and by
// insisting that all values that are to be thread_local are collected
// to be fields within a single class. This last restriction applies when the
// code is used on Linux or OSX, but the stack delicacies are not present
// in those cases.

// The code here has various bits of conditional compilation not just to
// discriminate between Windows and other systems but to let it take
// advantage of C++17 features when they are available. It can also be built
// so that the C++ "thread_local" qualifier is used on Windows or so that the
// special Windows-targetted scheme is activated elsewhere (it needs x86_64
// to work, since there is some assembly code!). That may be interesting
// for testing performance consequences.

// When this is compiled one (but not both!) of USE_NATIVE_THREAD_LOCAL
// or USE_FAKE_THREAD_LOCAL can be defined to control how this works. If
// you are building on Windows the FAKE option is the default. On all other
// systems the NATIVE one is the default.
