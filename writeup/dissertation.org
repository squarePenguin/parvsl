* Introduction

The motivation of this project is to explore the implementation of multi-threading
capabilities within a working compiler and assess the benefits and tradeoffs it brings
to an established, real-world application with a large, actively-developed body of code. 

** REDUCE

[[https://reduce-algebra.sourceforge.io/][REDUCE]] is a portable general-purpose algebra system (CAS). It enables symbolic
manipulation of mathematical expressions and provides a wide range of algorithms
to solve problems spanning many fields, with arbitrary precision numerical approximation. 
It has a friendly user interface and can display maths and generate graphics.

REDUCE is one of a few open-source general-purpose CAS programs, alongside Maxima and Axiom.
The three projects are all built on top of different Lisp kernels. At the time of this writing,
none of these projects have any multi-threaded capabilities. My aim is to remove this limitation
for REDUCE. The project is using its own Lisp dialect which is similar to Common Lisp, but has its
own design and set of capabilities.

** VSL

Over the years, there have been multiple implementations of the Lisp compiler REDUCE is using, with
different goals: PSL, CSL and VSL. VSL is an interpreted language written in the programming
language ~C~. It is fully capable of building the entirety of REDUCE, supports all the major 
platforms and architectures, and is well optimised for speed, minimising the performance tradeoff
of being interpreted.

** Benefits of multithreading

The idea of using parallel computing to speed up computer algebra computing has come
up in research papers for many years ~TODO reference it~, but much of the activity now
predates the now ubiquitous multi-core CPUs used in modern computers and the amount of memory
they now provide. Moreover, advancements in single-core CPU performance has slowed down
significantly, as clock speeds have stagnated and even gone down in recent years. The biggest
area of imrpovement in these new CPUs is their core count and number of hardware threads.
Binding the performance of Reduce to single-threaded performance is likely to lead to
a limitation in speed gains from new hardware.

** Code examples

To help explain the concepts I introduce, I will use code fragments showing the algorithms.
These fragments will be a simplification of the original code, in order to remove the need
for context within the rest of the codebase. I will use two programming languages in this review:
C++ and OCaml. C++ code will be used where the original code is on the Lisp interpreter.

For concepts related to the target language, I will be using OCaml instead of Lisp for readability.
Just like the original Lisp was only intended as an intermediate representation, Lisp is not used
in REDUCE directly. An additional language called ~RLISP~ is used instead. RLISP is simply aiming
to provide a more readable syntax, however this syntax is ALGOL inspired and unfamiliar to most
programmers nowadays. I have decided to use an ML style syntax in this writeup, which should aid
with brevity and readability.

** DONE ParVSL
   CLOSED: [2019-03-07 Thu 18:09]

I have forked the the original VSL project into a new language which I call for simplicity Parallel VSL, or ParVSL.
ParVSL is fully backwards compatible with VSL and will be tested against it for performance.

VSL was a good candidate for this project because it featured a complete, working Lisp implementation while being
small enough to be a managable project. The entire VSL codebase consists of around 10000 lines of code, all of which
was originally contained within a single file. Before making changes in critical areas, I spent some time familiarising
myself with the code. This included spliting the project in more more files, fixing a few obvious bugs, and porting
to C++.

** From C to C++

The VSL language was written in the programming language C. C is a language with no standardised
multi-threaded model and no native support for multi-core programming. Furthermore, it has no well-defined
memory model, and no ordering of memory accesses. Multi-threaded programming
is only possible in C through a third-party library, such as ~Windows threads~ or the 
the ~POSIX threads~ library on UNIX systems. Support further has to be guaranteed by individual compilers
and operating systems and can break between versions.

C++ is a superset of C and can compile existing, standard C code easily. The C++11 standard addresses the
above omissions, making C++ a multi-threaded language. While in some cases the implementation uses the same
libraries as the C equivalend (e.g POSIX), we do not have to think about these details and the code
we write is fully portable. The only requirement is that a C++11 compliant compiler is used to compile the
code and then which platforms these compilers can target.

The first change I have made to the implementation is to clear it of any incompatible code and compile it
with a C++ compiler. This was a trivial task and mostly involved adding a few more explicit casts.
However, I have been slowly transitioning the code from idiomatic C++ as I analysed more parts of it
and became confident those changes wouldn't affect the semantics of the program.

** DONE Throughput vs latency
   CLOSED: [2019-02-27 Wed 22:47]

When optimising for performance in a programming language, we have to analyse the tradeoff between
total thoughput and latency. Optimising for latency means minimising the duration of any individual
task in the program, and increasing availability. Optimising for throughput involves minimising the
total running time of the program. For example, a web server would benefit more from reducing latency
of any individual request.

In a CAS program the user is most likely to care about throughput, i.e. compute the output of large 
problem sizes as quickly as possible. The program is single-user and has a simple interface. The only case
for low latency is in the responsiveness of the graphical user interface. This is already provided by the 
operating system so our main goal is directed towards minimising throughput in the application. This is particularly
important when designing the garbage collector, described below.

** TODO Memory allocation

Memory is managed by the interpreter. It allocates a large block of memory at the beginning,
which it then manages as a contiguous array. When running out of memory, an extra block of the
same size as current available memory is malloced, doubling the amount available. These blocks are
never freed until the end of the program. These blocks are sorted by their pointer locations,
and carefully /joined/ together to maintain the abstract model of continguous memory. Binary search
is used to identify the block containing a location.

** DONE Garbage collector
   CLOSED: [2019-03-07 Thu 18:08]

An important feature of Lisp languages is their garbage collectors. Garbage collectors allow the programmer
to design code without having to worry about the lifecycle of their data, the internal memory model and
managing pointers. This makes Lisp code significantly easier to write, leaving the burden of providing safety and
efficiency to the compiler.

In effect, the garbage collector is an important component of the VSL interpreter and careful considerations
have to be made when modifying it. First of all, any bugs in the garbage collector may leave the memory in 
an invalid state, corrupting the state of the program and leading to undefined behaviour in C. Such errors 
are also very difficult to spot and debug, as they can go undetected until the particular region of memory
is accessed again.

*** DONE Cheaney's algorithm
    CLOSED: [2019-03-07 Thu 18:08]

The approach a garbage collector uses to deal with freed memory affects both its performance and memory usage.
Before the first garbage collection cycle, memory can simply be allocated in a continuous fashion, making it
compact and fast. When the garbage collector finds unreachable objects and eliminates them, they will leave /gaps/ behind
and causing /fragmentation/. Not dealing with fragmentation of memory leads to wasted memory. Keeping track of the gaps
and filling them with objects of the right size involves extra book-keeping which can be quite expensive. Ultimately,
it is impossible to guarantee the gaps are filled efficiently, because the garbage collector cannot predict future
memory allocations, and thus heuristics have to be employed.

VSL avoids this problem entirely by using a copying garbage collector. This means it compacts memory by moving 
traceable objects to a new region. The unreachable objects are simply not moved and they will eventually be overwritten. 
This method has the advantage that it fully compacts memory, fixing the issue of fragmentation in an efficient,
straight-forward way. The main trade-off this approach has is the total memory usage. A region of memory at least
as large as the one in use has to be used to copy the live objects into. In addition, when a very large amount 
of memory is in use, the copying of all live memory might become more expensive than managing the free memory.
The problem sizes in REDUCE are usually not bound by memory on modern computers, with none of the applications
being known to use more than one gigabyte. This makes the copying approach suitable for the language. 

Cheaney's algorithm is a method of stop-the-world copying garbage collection. The virtual /heap/ is divided into
two halves, and only one half is in use for allocations. The other half is considered free and used during garbage
collection. When the first half is full and garbage collection is triggered, all traceable objects are copied over
to the second half. Then, the two halves are swapped.

To start the tracing we need to consider a root set: a subset of object which are guaranteed to be accessible.
One example of elements in the root set is the table of symbols; more precisely all symbols which are defined at the start
of the garbage collection. The stack will also pointers to objects and must be scanned when computing the root set.
While these are the main compontents of the root set, the interpreter may contain others depending on language features
and implementation, all of which must be spotted and added.

Once we have distinguished a root set, we can trace all references to build the reachable set. Objects may contain references
to other objects, which are also considered reachable. For example, all elements of a list must be traced recursively. 
The reachable set is the transitive closure of the reachability relation. All objects in the reachable set must be kept
during collection, while eveything else may be safely collected.

#+END_SRC 

The algorithm presented above is a heavility simplified abstraction. The root set includes other
locations apart from the symbol table, and all of them have to be handled carefully. This was an area
of particular importance when adding multi-threading.

The ~copy~ and ~copycontent~ procedures have to read the heap to determine the type, size and fields of
the ~LispObject~, and act accordingly. This approach of storing all the information inside the virtual heap
and manually accessing it as need has significant performance benefits. ~LispObject~ becomes a simple aliasing
for a pointer type, it allows many different types of objects (integers, floats, strings, lists) to be accessed
in a unified way, while staying compact in memory. The disadvantage is that it is is difficult to track memory
corruption, making debugging very difficult. This will become a problem if any bug in the code produces a data-race.

*** DONE Conservative GC
    CLOSED: [2019-03-07 Thu 18:08]

One important design aspect of calculating the root set is how to handle references on the stack. Garbage collection
may start in the middle of a large computation and the reference on the stack cannot be discarded. One safe, but slow
approach of dealing with this is to keep a virtual stack. Such a stack could be well typed and easily scanned to find
references. However, it would be much slower by adding a level of indirection to each expression, and it would also make
the code more difficult to manage.

Another approach is to tag words in memory. This approach is used, for instance, by the OCaml compiler, where the least
significant bit is a tag bit, indicating whether that word is a pointer reference or just data. This approach is better
than the virtual stack, but has the drawback of limiting the integer types (e.g 63bit vs 64), and requiring additional
instructions (i.e shifts) to do arithmetic.

The approach VSL uses is to be conservative. It treats all values as potential references, called /ambiguous/ roots.
The means we are overestimating the set of roots. Unlike /unambiguous/ roots (like the symbol table above), we
have to be careful when handling these values, and cannot manipulate them as ~LispObject~. This rules out calling
~copy~ or ~copycontent~ above on them, but they still need to be kept during garbage collection. The solution was
to /pin/ them. Any location on our heap which is pointed to by an ambiguous root is pinned and not copied over.
Additionally, the ~allocate~ function will have to check for pinned items on the heap and skip over them. This
additional book-keeping is managable, When building the entirety of REDUCE, the number of pinned items is never
larger than 300. Considering memory used is in the order of megabytes, these pinned locations cause negligible
fragmentation.

** Variable lifetime

As the original language is decades old, its mechanism for variable lifecycle is not in line with that of modern languages.
This mechanism was counter-intuitive at first, and is lacking in providing safety to the user of the language.

There are two lifetime specifiers for symbols: /global/ and /fluid/. It is important to note that they
do not refer semantically to variables but only to symbol *names*.

A /global/ symbols has only a single globally visible value. That means you cannot bind the name to any local
variable. For instance if ~x~ is declared global, it then cannot be used as a function parameter name, or in a
let binding.

A /fluid/ variable has a global value, but can also be locally bound. Fluids behave more like globals do
in other languages, allowing the name to be reused.

~Let~ bindings and function parameters introduce /local/ symbols. If the symbol name is already declared global,
it will result in an error. If it is a fluid and has a global value, that value will be shadowed for the lifetime
of the binding.

To make it easier to use it as a scripting language, REDUCE's Lisp allows using symbols that aren't global, fluid,
or locally bound. These will act like local variables, except their lifetime will be defined for the duration of the
program. For single-threaded programs, this distinction is not important: these variable would act like fluids. However,
when implementing multithreading, fluids have a global value visible to all threads, while these symbols are only
visible on their local thread. I will call these symbols /unbound locals/.

** DONE Saving state to disk
   CLOSED: [2019-03-07 Thu 20:08]

REDUCE has an important feature which allows the user to preserve the state to disk. A ~preserve~ instruction can be
used to do so, and the user is able to specify a function to run on restart. Preserve saves the entire state of the
program, including memory and symbols. The feature involves careful manipulation of the world state and it can maintaining
it unaffected when enabling multi-threaded programs is complicated. I ran into a few challanges when implementing ParVSL,
which I will discuss in the implementation chapter.

* TODO Implementation


** TODO Memory allocation

All the memory is global and shared, and multiple threads will often try
to allocate concurently, causing contention. A naive solution to this problem
would have been to use a mutex lock on allocations. While this would be easy to
implement, it would also severely degrade performance. Locks are expensive even
in single-threaded scenarios with no contention, and allocations are very common
when evaluating Lisp. This is especially the case in an interpreted Lisp were no
allocations are optimisied away. Simply reading the code to evaluate allocates
\(O(n)\) times for code of length \(n\). That is because code in Lisp code is data.
Each instruction is a list data structure, with each elements allocated.
Serialising allocations is guaranteed to slow down the language enough to cancel 
any advantage multi-threading brings to the language.
Indeed, we can easily see the impact when trying to build reduce:

|   | VSL | MUTEX | SEGMENT |
|---+-----+-------+---------|
|   |     |       | 2m1s    |
 
I wanted to allow multiple threads in parallel without affecting the performance
of allocations. To do this I had to use a lock-free approach. To do this, I further
split the memory into regions, which I call /segments/. A segment is a thread-local region
for allocation in memory.

 Just like before, memory is allocated to the segments in a continuous 
fashion. A pointer indicates the start of the non-allocated part of the segment(the /segment fringe/.), 
while another tells us the end of the segment(the /segment limit/). 


Now, contention is reduced to getting a new
segment. Each thread only allocates within its own segment, so allocations do not require
any synchronisation, and they still only require incrementing one variable in most
cases.

Global regions are are kept and handled in sorted order by their location in memory.

Memory allocation are contained within a /segment/. When attempting to allocate for the first time,
or after a garbage collection cycle, a thread will request a new segment. If there is not
enough memory left to allocate a new segment, this will trigger a garbage collection cycle, and possibly
extend total memory. Otherwise, TODO

Each segment is defined by a /fringe/ and a /limit/. When a new object is allocated, the fringe is
compared to the limit to test whether there is enough available space within the segment. If the segment
cannot accommodate the requested allocation it is considered full and a new segment is requested.

Sometimes, a new object might need to be allocated which is comparable or larger than the default segment size.



The code was modified so that checks and operations on the global block "fringe"
affect the thread-local segment fringe. The block fringe is only modified under a lock
when a thread asks for a new segment. Segment sizes can be decided dinamically,
but will generally be a minimum fixed size which has to be tuned for performance.
The tradeoff here is performance vs memory. If the segments are too small then there
will be contention as threads request new segments too often. When segments are larger than 
needed, they hold chunks of memory from being used by other threads and can lead 
to more garbage collection cycles. 

** DONE Data races in the interpreter
   CLOSED: [2019-03-07 Thu 20:51]

The interpreter runs a read-eval-print loop which makes heavy use of global state and side effects.

All named objects in the lifecycle of the program are /symbols/. All global and local variables, including
special ones (like ~true~ or ~nil~) and function arguments are symbols. A global hash-table keeps track of
all symbols. This means each names can only be in use in one place at once. 

Lisp is a language with dynamic scope. 

#+BEGIN_SRC ocaml
let f x = x + y in
let g () =
  let y = 3 in
  f 2
in
g ()
#+END_SRC

The above example will not compile in any static language such as OCaml or C++ 
because the variable ~y~ is not defined in its scope.
Most dynamic languages, even weakly typed ones, like Javascript or Python, will allow equivalent
code as valid, but will encounter a runtime error because ~y~ is not defined.
Lisp, and VSL in particular, has a mach looser concept of scope.
In the example above, ~y~ is defined before the call of ~f~ and will remain defined until the
call to ~g~ returns. 

Shallow binding is the mechanism by which this is achieved. Each symbol is mapped to a single value.
When a variable name is bound, e.g. as a function parameter name during a function call or through a
~let~ statement, its old value is stored by the interpreter and replaced with the new value. At the end of the binding,
the old value is restored. The main advantage of this method is performance. Old values can simply be saved
on the stack:

#+BEGIN_SRC ocaml
let varName = expr1 in expr2
#+END_SRC

can be implemented as:

#+BEGIN_SRC C++
void implement_let(string varName, LispObject expr1, LispObject expr2) {
  LispObject symbol = lookup_symbol(varName);
  LispObject oldVal = value(symbol); // store the old value
  value(symbol) = eval(expr1);       // replace with new value
  eval(expr2);                       // evaluate the rest of the code
  value(symbol) = oldVal;            // restore old value
}
#+END_SRC

This mechanism was not designed with concurrency in mind, and is not thread-safe. 
Many variable names are reused multiple times in a program, for example ~i, j, count~, etc.
Multiple threads binding the same variable will cause override each other's values.

I wanted to fix this while keeping the same dynamic scoping semantics for backward compatibility 
and not affecting performance. To do this, I have allocated thread-local storage for symbols.
Global symbols were unaffected, because rebinding them is illegal in the language. However,
for non-globals I used a thread-local array to store the real value, and had the global storage
location point to the array location. Each local symbol gets its own unique array index for the lifecycle
of the program. Then, each thread will reserve that location within its local array for the symbol.
Then, I created the function:

#+BEGIN_SRC C++
LispObject par_value(LispObject symbol) {
  LispObject val = value(symbol);        // use the original value function here
  if (is_global(symbol)) return val;     // global symbols remain unaffected  

  // ASSERT: val is a Location otherwise
  Location loc = value_to_location(val); // "extract" location, an integer type
  return local_value(loc);               // get the thread_local value at that location               
}
#+END_SRC

I carefully replaced all calls to ~value~ to ~par_value~. Now, multiple threads accessing the same symbol
can do so safely, as they will each access their own versions. This eliminates data races entirely.

*** TODO make diagram
 


** DONE Shared memory and global variables
   CLOSED: [2019-03-07 Thu 20:51]

VSL has dynamic scoping and exhibits shallow binding. This means there is a global
storage mapping each symbol to exactly one value. A variable is defined as long 
as the symbol is assigned a value. The user can explicitly mark a symbol as global
or fluid. A global symbol only has a global value and cannot be locally bound.
A fluid symbol can have both a global value and a locally bound value. The way this
is accomplished is by saving the global value on every binding and then restoring it
as soon as the binding is over. 

This shallow binding approach is incompatible with a multi-threaded program: a symbol
could be locally bound to different values on different threads. One approach to solving the
issue is to use a deep-binding approach: passing around an associative list mapping the symbols
to values. The approach would add a penalty to performance, however it should be investigated
how significant the trade-off is. Instead, I have modified the code to try to keep the
shallow-binding. Global values work just as before and no modification is needed. For local and
fluids however, I added a thread-local storage array. The global storage now only
holds a pointer to the array location where the actual value is stored. This way, each thread can
hold its own version of the symbol and modify it safely. For fluids, there will still be a global
shared value. Since I already used the global storage for the pointer, I added one more global
array, where the pointer indicates the global value.

** TODO Thread data and garbage collection

The garbage collector is stop-the-world and work by tracing reachable memory locations
starting from a root set. There are two types of roots: ambiguous and unambigous. Unambiguous
roots are the ones explicitly managed by the compiler, e.g the symbol table of variables.
Since the compiler is written in C and memory is not tagged, we can also get ambigous pointer:
values on the C stack which might be just values but could also be pointers to program storage.

The handling of both of these root sets has to account for multiple running threads. All the new
thread-local storage was added to the unambiguous root set. Additionally, each thread is running its
own stack so all the stacks has to be accounted for as the ambiguous root set. The latter is more complicated.
All threads have to be paused before garbage collection can begin so that they do not interfere
with memory. A simple way to do this is to enable a global flag which all threads check on a regular basis.
However, if we are not careful, this can easily cause a deadlock (e.g: thread A waits for a signal from
thread B, but thread B is waiting for garbage collection). To solve such issues, I need to make two
changes. First, I must modify the functions in the interpreter to poll the global flag. Then I have
to make all waiting calls put a thread into a /safe/ state before sleeping, so that the garbage collector
can proceed with the thread. This is still a work in progress.

** TODO Saving state to disk and reloading

One important feature of the language is the ability to preserve the state of the world at any
time and save to disk. It is difficult to keep the same guarantees when multiple threads are running:
preserving when some of the threads are running a computation is tricky to define properly. To simplify
matter, I have decided that all threads have to be joined before preserving. This way, the state of
the world is consistent and relatively easy to restore. I have modified parts of the code to write
all the thread-local data back into global storage and then restore it when reloading. This way the same
file format is preserved, and I have not broken compatibility between single and multi-threaded images. 

** TODO Implementing threads

Once all the modifications above were made, implementing the actual multi-threading mechanism was an easy
task. I used the standard library to start and join threads and created a thread table so that data about
all threads can be accessed globally. WHen a  new thread is created, it registers a pointer to its thread-local
data in the table. Using this, I added code to the garbage collector to handle all existing threads and
extract the roots, but also to manage their allocation segments, which have to be reset after collection.
Finally, primitive functions for threading were added to the language. They simply mirror their C++ counterparts.
 
** TODO Thread communication
** TODO Lock-free symbol lookup

Just like allocations are a critical region of code in VSL, so are symbol lookups.
Every occurence of a symbol must be looked upin the symbol table. If the symbol does
not exist, it will be created. Multiple threads looking up symbols will cause contention.
If two threads try to allocate the same symbol name at the same time, they will invalidate
the table. 

#+BEGIN_SRC C++
LispObject symbols[SYMBOLS_SIZE];

LispObject lookup(std::string name) {
  size_t loc = hash(name) % SYMBOLS_SIZE;

  LispObject bucket = symbols[loc];

  while (bucket != nil) {
    LispObject s = head(bucket); // first list element
    
    if (symbol_name(s) == name) {
      // found the symbol
      return s;
    }

    bucket = tail(bucket); // rest of the list
  }

  LispObject s = allocate_symbol(name);
  symbols[loc] = cons(s, bucket);

  return s;
}

#+END_SRC

As before, the naive solution would be to implement a mutex lock on the entire 
lookup function.


To improve on that I tried to use a reader-writer lock. Reader-writer locks allow grant access 
to either a single writing thread, or all the reading threads. This would would allow multiple
threads to lookup symbols at the same time, however, as soon as one one thread has to create a
symbol, all th reader have to wait for it to finish.

Moreover, the lookup function is two-step: first it tries to find a symbol, then it creates one 
if it didn't find any. If two threads lookup the same symbol at the same time, it is possible for
both of them to end try to create it at the same time. The reader-writer lock would not prevent this!
It would serialise the writes, so it does prevent undefined behaviour in C++, however it does still
create the symbol twice. The pointer to the symbol that the first thread returned from the function 
would become invalid.

I have found a third approach, based on the Compare-and-swap (CAS) instruction which solves the issue
above, while also providing a lock-free implementation. The symbol lookup table is currently implemented
as static array of linked list.

Instead, I replaced it with:
#+BEGIN_SRC C++
std::atomic<LispObject> symbol_table[TABLE_SIZE];

LispObject lookup(std::string name) {
  size_t loc = hash(name) % SYMBOLS_SIZE;

  LispObject bucket = symbols[loc].load(std::memory_order_acquire);

  while (bucket != nil) {
    LispObject s = head(bucket); // first list element
    
    if (symbol_name(s) == name) {
      // found the symbol
      return s;
    }

    bucket = tail(bucket); // rest of the list
  }

  LispObject s = allocate_symbol(name);

  LispObject new_bucket = cons(s, bucket);

  while (!symbols[loc].compare_exchange_strong(bucket, new_bucket, std::memory_order_release)) {
    // search for stored value
    LispObject old_bucket = bucket;   
    bucket = symbols[loc].load(std::memory_order_acquire);

    for (LispObject s; s != old_bucket; s = tail(s)) {
      if (symbol_name(s) == name) {
        // Another name created the symbol. Use that.
        return s;
      }
    }

    // Make sure we don't discard new symbols inserted by other threads.
    new_bucket = cons(s, bucket);
  }

  return s;
}
